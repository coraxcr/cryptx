To run this application in dev-mode you must have installed nodejs. 

### To install the packages use:
```
npm install 
```

### To run the application in dev mode use:
```
npm run
```

### To create the production deploy package use the following command:

```
npm run-script build
```
Once you have created the "build" proceed checking the production build with "[Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)" service.

### Static Server

For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:

```
npm install -g serve
```
```
serve -s build
```
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -l or --listen flags:
```
serve -s build -l 4000
```


### Notes:

This application uses coinmarketcap.com API, and a token (never add an authentication token on your applications) to fetch data, it's limited to 300 request per day. 
Use an extension on your browser to disable CORS headers, recommended one: "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin".
